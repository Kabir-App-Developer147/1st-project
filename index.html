          An aspect of biology that interests me is the evolution of humans over many hundreds of years. Human evolution began six million years ago in Africa. This has been proven countless times by evidence such as fossils of human remains which can be dated back to many million years ago.
<br>
<br>
Our first ever relative was a fish that existed 400-350 MYA. It was called the Notharctus Tenebrosus and its first fossil was discovered in 187in 1870. It is linked with the human species as it shared a unique characteristic which was the opposable thumb, this is because life living in trees caused fingers to grow in length so you could reach the edible fruit. They also had large hind limbs and a tail which helped with weight distribution. It also provides another important characteristic which is coloured vision. Early primates had a limited colour range but then the one group discovered full red, green, and blue vision to tell the difference from the ripe fruits and the green ripe fruits. 
<br>
<br>
First, we have a clear relationship with Apes, and this was discovered as our genetic makeup is quite similar. For example, around about 98.5% of the genes we find in people are also in chimpanzees. This does mean that they are our closest living relative however this does not mean that we have evolved from the chimpanzees. It does suggest that we share a common ancestor with modern apes like chimpanzees, therefore we are related to the primates, but we do descend from them. We have however evolved in numerous ways from chimps as human brains are larger thus more complex. This means that have different varying cultures and languages, people can also walk upright. Humans can also speak and manipulate objects unlike these apes. 
<br>
<br>
Darwinâ€™s natural selection theory can explain why we have differentiated from chimpanzees. The main points of the theory were: struggle for existence, Variation, survival of the fittest and then reproduction of the fittest animals. In the stages of human evolution, the Dryopithecus is generally considered the ancestor to apes and humans but the diverge from the line is still debatable. Dryopithecus lived in Africa, China, India and Europe. The name means oak wood apes as it is believed environmental conditions were dense with trees and they could have been predominantly herbivores.
<br>
<br>
Next are the Ramapithecus and they were first discovered in Punjab in the Shivalik Hills and then found later in Africa and Saudi Arabia. They had a habit which consisted of not only trees but also grassland. Fossils show that they had a thickened jaw enamel and more robust jaws. Next is the Australopithecus, and they were first found in 1924 at Taung, Africa. They would walk erect and they lived on the ground. They could have also used stone to hunt animals.
<br>
<br>
Then the Hume Erectus was discovered in Java in 1891, by Eugene Dubois. They had a bigger cranial capacity than the Australopithecus and used fire. Stone tools were made of quartz and evidence suggests of big game hunting and it must have been in collective cooperative groups. They seemed to have lived in caves, thus the use of fire is important.

            <p id="mars"> Not a joke! I am not talking about going mars tommorow, have the perspective that these predictions are 200-300 years in the future. As it is an intrest of absolutely rich people like Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos to go to mars you would be familier with the concept of Settleing in other planets. Elon has already announced that by 2030 they will be sending their very first batch of people to colonize on Mars. As you see the population of earth would only go up now and the resources will be insufficient. So this is one way people think to overcome these problems however it has many more problems of itself unlike the second one which I prefer more.  </p>

              <p id="earth"> From the idustrial boom from the 17s factories became a big deal. People started to buy everything readymade all over europe. Around 50 years later the economical boom came around. Now the entire world was running on machines. Everything from your cloths to your car was know made by a machine. This suddeen rise of buissness only rose. In the mid 1950s the growth of the economy was starting to go haywire in Europe, China, India, Japan and USA. Now China is the main supplier of goods. All this manufacturing and machinery and growth in populution has been terrible from the environment. In 200 hundred years We turned earth from a plesent paradise to planet filled with pollution. We must stop now and start to develope the things we already have  in a eco-friendly way. We can still Improve, We should stop now. This line also represents the next prediction which suggests that we should really stop. </p>

              <p id="imp">AI has already gone too far. One wrong step could destroy everything for us. It won't take while till AI becomes real intelligence and then it couild think that we are a threat and destroy us. Machinery and robots are already so attached in our life. A computer with real Intelligence could proggram itself and all the other computers was fast then we can create an anti-virus. It can then do anything that it want's. It can launch nukes on all the majour cities because they are also now computerized. This Third prediction is a big threat to humanity. With that I end this Section </p>
